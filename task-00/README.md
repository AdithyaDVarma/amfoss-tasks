# Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]

 I am new to Ubuntu and I installed it via dual-boot because it is quite necessary for the tasks given to us.Please remember that for the disk managementAlso this task is quite easy but also risky.So I just did my dual booting in the HP Store  mainly because my system was new and I don't want to make any damages in the system.

 But you can try it yourself by refering these YouTube videos:-
