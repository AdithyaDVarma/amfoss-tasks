# About Tasks
The tasks were tough for me because many of them were new like JS,Bandit tasks,Go language,and also the Git ones too.But I also agree that those tasks could be done by any freshers if they had put their time and effort into it.These tasks have made a exposure to many things that is used around us and the most important one I liked is the introduction of many new languages because I used only Windows ever since I used a PC . The tasks were all beginner friendly and promotes the way of doing and learning new concepts by ourselves

# Self-intro
Hiya mentors

My name is Adithya D Varma and I am from Kottayam,Kerala.I studied in Placid Vidya Vihar,Changanashery.I came to know about amFOSS club from my cousin,who studied their in the college and also from Quora.From these I cam e to know that the club promotes and supports our knowledge and gives real-life experience and improves our coding skills too.By doing these tasks,I feel like I improved and get to know more about new stuff.



# Incompletion  of my tasks

I will come clean to you, I had very littile time to work on the tasks.

First ,I am very new to these tasks and yes it took me some time to understand these tasks

Second, my schedule.I know that many students of my age are able to do almost 80% of the tasks by the time given.TBH,I have started getting assignemnts by the 1 week of college.
And I am from AI batch ,so I have to attend well and score good marks for it as I have a continuous evaluation system.After that I am getting quizes and class tests,frankly those were raining on me. Classes from 8:30 am to 5 pm  and after that studying the portions and doing some assignments and all.

Third,Lack of hands-on experience.I have no experience while doing the tasks and it took me a lot of time to just do simple tasks and also getting introduced to new interfaces etc.This honestly took most of the time left and also referring YouTube and Google and other sources.

I have genuinely went through all the tasks but due to these reasons and the limited amount of time I was unable to complete everything and have to make like few incompleted tasks too.
I hope the tasks i have done was satisfactory and looking forward for your positive feedback :)
