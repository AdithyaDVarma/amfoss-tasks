# About Tasks
The tasks were tough for me because many of them were new like JS,Bandit tasks,Go language,and also the Git ones too.But I also agree that those tasks could be done by any freshers if they had put their time and effort into it.These tasks have made a exposure to many things that is used around us and the most important one I liked is the introduction of many new languages because I used only Windows ever since I used a PC . The tasks were all beginner friendly and promotes the way of doing and learning new concepts by ourselves
