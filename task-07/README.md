# WebScrapper

So downloaded the VS code software and I was ready with Go. Then by following a tutorial [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KsE7zMm-AI&t=1160s)

I started and I was faced by this error [here](Scrappererror.png)

I even used the git code for colly ie: go get -u github.com/gocolly/colly/...

Then I thought something wrong with my system so I updated the Go tools and even restarted the system many times.
 I even tried to import colly manually still didnt work.
 Then I think a decision (for me it was stupid) to reinstall both Go and VS.
 When I did that not even a single code worked and everytime it was showing me compilor error or package not found etc
 
 The photo I shared was the best I could do in my limited time.
