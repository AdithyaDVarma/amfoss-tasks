# Commands I used


1. mkdir command
      It stands for Make Directory and is used to create a folder on the spot it is assigned to
      
2. cd command 
      It stands for change directory and is used to change from Home directory to the directory specified.
      
3. cat command:
      It stands for concatenate and is used read a file or combine different files.
      
 4. For combining two or more text files,I used the command
      cat <txtfile1.txt> <txtfile2.txt> > <txtfile3.txt>
   
5. echo command:
      The syntax is like this echo "<Your message>" > <textfile>
  
6.mv command:
      This command stands for move and is used to move files from one directory to another and is also used to rename a directory.

7. Renaming branch name
      I had to change my git branch because initially when I pushed my project files it ended up in master branch
      So the syntax used is
      git branch -m <old><new>
  
8. Git push
      For this I used these commnads
      
      git init:
               It is used to initialize an existing repository
       
      git remote add origin "<Link of your repo>"
  
      git remote -v
  
      git add.
     
      git commit -m "<Yourcommit>"
  
      git push origin main
  
  
  
  
  And thats it .This is how I managed to push my repo
