# My approach

I was kinda able to identify the common errors like brackets and name errors etc
But still I was getting some other errors I was not familiar with C language at all. So I used a help from a family friend and he also helped me to debugged the whole program.
I hope the program works because the final one hasn't shown any errors or something. :)

I used an online C [compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler) and it ran the code.
