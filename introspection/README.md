# Introspection
### Why must we choose you?
My interest in coding started from 11th.But I did study basics of C++ before 10th,but I forgot all those basics and during then I also kinda neglected those things and moved on.I was extremely weak in Biology because studying byheart and mugging up my answers are not a cup of tea for me
