# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
My interest in coding started from 11th.But I did study basics of C++ before 10th,but I forgot all those basics and during then I also kinda neglected those things and moved on.I was extremely weak in Biology because studying byheart and mugging up my answers are not a cup of tea for me.From 11th,I studied Python and I really loved that language because it was easy to understand and so much user friendly compared to others(based on me).So I am pretty sure that the amFOSS club would guide me and improve my skills on coding and also help me improving in academics.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
My dream is to work for the software development team of a reputated company.So to achieve that,I would contribute my help to  the work in the club and also get some time to study as many programming languages as possible and also co-studying my academics as well.I do hope that the club will also give me the space to work for it.
### How would you contribute back to the club? 
I will try ny extreme best to help and satisfy the things said by the club.My efforts will be duly noted by the mentors and will be satisfied.
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Actually I do agree that the selection process is pretty good for beginners.But I would also recommend some more time because some languages need a very good understanding because for a person with/without no-programming background would find a bit tedious and will face some pressure.Other than that,I would argueably agree that your process is very good.
