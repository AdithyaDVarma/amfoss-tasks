# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?

The interest towards learning computer started during school days and got opportunity to learn more during my 11th standard. Started learning the basics of C++ at Standard 10, unfortunately I forgot those basics as it was not practiced later. I realized that Physics; Chemistry and Mathematics would be my best option as I am weak in Biology. The challenge faced is by heart the notes, which is not my cup of tea. Got the opportunity to learn the basics of Phython during my 11th standard and it reiterates and helped me to take a decision about my future studies. Python, as a language, is easy to understand while comparing other programs. After the 12th exam,  with the help of my parents and friends, collected the activities of clubs in the engineering colleges and I heard a lot of positive feedback about amFOSS club and it is one of the reason for my decision to be part of Amrita School of Engineering and I am sure that the active members in the club will help me in improving my skills and guide me to reach my goal.


### What is your plan for the next 6 months?

I have chosen B Tech (CSE) as my carrier with an aim to do by Masters and I would like to be part of creative software development team of a reputed company. I strongly believe that the association with the club would be a help to climb up on the ladders. Learning more about Software Development activities and languages will help not only in understanding the practices, but it will support me in academic subjects. Hence my immediate plan would be, become an active & productive member in the club and work as a team to achieve the short / long term goals.


### How would you contribute back to the club? 

My contribution to the club would be the assurance from my side that I would be an active member in the club and I a eager to be part of the most vibrant team which lead by my senior members - the MENTORS.


### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

As a beginner, the evaluation process which is derived by the club is enthusiastic and I support it. My request to my Mentors to give additional time, as we are new to the programming and practical implementation. Learning the art of coding requires little more time and I am confident that the selection process helps our Mentors to know more about the fresh team and they can derive the best plan to create a productive team.
