The code also got accepted but it got terminated due to timeout and got a score of 25.00

## Euler3
The code was only able to run one case initially so later I spent some time messing around and looking at logic.Then made a small tweak and it got accepted and got a score of 80.00 because one of the test case didnt accepted it
