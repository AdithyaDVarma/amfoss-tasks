## Euler1
The code got accepted but it got terminated due to timeout and got a score of 60.00

## Euler2
The code also got accepted but it got terminated due to timeout and got a score of 25.00

## Euler3
The code was only able to run one case initially so later I spent some time messing around and looking at logic.Then made a small tweak and it got accepted and got a score of 80.00 because one of the test case didnt accepted it

## Euler4
The problem I am facing is that the code has runtime error because of the huge input value .My code basically runs through 0 to n and each of the value of this range is multiplied  to the same range in another loop and the pallindrome is checked.
So the code has run time error.I tried to fix it like finding direct equations or something but nothing I could find :(
